            This is a story of a once upon a time curious, confused, lost,
            rebellious child. Early in life, I had so many questions. I still
            have so many questions, only difference is I barely ask them
            anymore. Life has its way of shaping you, do I like my shape?
            Physically-yes, mentally-not so much.

            I’ve lost a lot of my curiosity, is this what trauma does to you?
            trauma from poverty? I like to think of poverty's methods as silent
            chisels that carve deep lines into the face of hope. I probably lost
            a lot of enthusiasm due to having a really poor mentality, lack of
            exposure also played a big part. Now that I think of it, what more
            exposure could I have asked for? I had my tertiary education at the
            prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University and I still didn’t get enough
            exposure? that’s funny and wrong! I got exposed to the wrong things
            the wrong way of thinking. I guess that counts as no exposure
            anyways.

            But, enough of that. There's something exposure does something to
            you, I can say with a lot of confidence that I’ve learnt a lot in
            the past few months due to a change of mentality and proper
            exposure, I mean, I’m here learning how to code and staying
            consistent with it(I can’t remember the last time I was consistent
            with anything). Poverty was a barrier early in life, or so I
            thought, however with a change in mentality and more exposure I’ve
            come to realize poverty is the whip that drives desperation.
            Applying to AltSchool Africa was out of desperation; desperation to
            make a name for family, desperation to add value to myself,
            desperation to change my standard of living.

            I’m happy I took that huge step, cause it kickstarted a chain
            reaction, I saw the power of daily improvement from consistently
            writing code and it has impacted several aspects of my life. It has
            taught me that I can become a better person by putting in 1% daily
            towards self-improvement. Enough said, need to go write some code.
            I’m starting to enjoy writing btw, it’s so calming. Ps; I wrote this
            hoping no one would read this, do not mind my writing, I’m new to
            this.
